# QLSC 612 - Fundamentals for Neuro Data Science

## Course overview

Neuroscientists increasingly rely on openly-accessible data and on advanced
methodological procedures for their investigations.
Data science offers a key set of tools and methods to efficiently analyze, visualize, and interpret
neuroscience data.
Concurrently, there is a growing concern in the life sciences
that many results produced are difficult or even impossible to reproduce,
commonly referred to as the “reproducibility crisis.”

This course brings together software and analytical tools and methods in order to teach
students how to best use the fundamentals of data science in their daily work
to produce reproducible results.

We will take examples in neuroimaging and see how
to use computational tools, statistical and machine learning techniques,
and collaborative, open science methodologies to generate results
that are statistically robust and computationally reproducible.

The course builds on the [ReproNim](https://www.repronim.org/) materials for reproducible neuroimaging research.

## Objective, scope, and intended audience

QLSC-612 is intended for researchers in the life sciences (neurologists,
psychiatrists, psychologists, neuroscientists) who wish to improve their
research practices, or other researchers who want an introduction to data
science with examples in neuroscience and neuroimaging.

At the end of thecourse, students will be able to analyze neuroscience
and neuroimaging data in a reproducible and collaborative manner
using the Python software stack (a popular and rapidly growing contender
in the landscape of neuroscience data analysis).

Amongst the topics, we will cover both the fundamentals of tools (bash, git,
github, jupyter, docker, visualization) and analysis methods (hypothesis
testing, machine learning) at the conceptual and practical levels.

See objectives of each module [here]({{ site.url }}/lectures-materials/latest.html).

In terms of requirements, students will be expected to have basic programming
skills (such as minimal experience in a scripting language).

### pre-recorded videos

Video content of this course is available on Youtube
[from previous editions](https://www.youtube.com/@qls612-bhs9/videos)
of the course. The content might vary slightly from this year's content. 

## Approach to teaching

Students will be required to attend in-person lectures for all of the modules
and will have access to [lectures materials and online content]({{ site.url }}/lectures-materials/latest.html)
to better consolidate the material.

The course requires that you have a laptop and instructions for installation are [here]({{ site.url }}/setup/setup.html).

Course grading will be based on the results of 2 in-person quizzes (see [schedule]({{ site.url }}/tut-schedule.html)).

Students taking the course for credit will have to attend lectures
in room 189 (QLS Conference Room) of 550 Sherbrooke Street W.
