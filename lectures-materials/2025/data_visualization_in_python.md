## Outline

-   Data visualization is an essential skill for scientists.

-   At the grad student level, you're probably already familiar with basic plots
    (for example, bar plot vs pie chart), as well as types of data (e.g, ordered vs categorical).

-   With that in mind, I hope to take you a bit deeper
    into the technicalities of planning and executing and effictive Figure.
