## Outline

Git and GitHub are key tools for doing version control in both academia and industry.

These tools can help students do more efficient, open, and reproducible research.

Further, knowing these tools can help prepare students for careers in academia and industry.

In this lecture, students will learn:

-   What is version control and why has it become so important in science and industry;
-   How to track and share their own work using git and GitHub; and
-   How to collaborate and contribute to open projects using git and GitHub.

## Questions you will be able to answer after taking this module

-   In a **\_\_\_\_** version control system, individuals have the entire repository and its history in their local repository.
    1.  Centralized
    1.  Distributed

-   What is the basic workflow for tracking a change and sharing it on github?
    1.  `git commit`, `git add`, `git push`
    1.  `git pull`, `git add`, `git push`
    1.  `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`

-   How do you start a parallel line of development, in order to do nonlinear  version control?
    1.  make a tag
    1.  start a new branch
    1.  create a remote repository

-   How do you make a copy of another GitHub repo on your GitHub account?
    1.  `git clone <repo address>`
    1.  go to the repo's GitHub page and click "fork"
    1.  go to the repo's GitHub page and open an issue to ask for a copy
    1.  go to the repo's GitHub page and do a pull request
