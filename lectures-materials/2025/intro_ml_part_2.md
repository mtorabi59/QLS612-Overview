## Outline

In this module, you will:

-   Understand the challenges of learning from high-dimensional data and learn about tools to mitigate the issue.
-   Understand the goal of clustering and the concept of grouping similar data points.

## Questions you will be able to answer after taking this module

-   What is the "curse of dimensionality", and how might it affect the performance of my model?

-   How can I reduce the dimensionality of my data while preserving as much information as possible?

-   How does K-means clustering work, step by step?

-   How should I choose the right number of clusters in when applying clustering?

-   How can I evaluate the quality of my clustering results?
